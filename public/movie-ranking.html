<h1>The Greatest Animes ever! According to Jay Hogan</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Animes of All-Time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime because of the graphics and Tanjiro's determination is inspiring.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>I like Naruto because the story is crazy and the show builds emotional connection to characters.</p>
<h3>Attack of Titan</h3>
<p>The plot twist in the show keeps you interested. Very dramatic and suspenseful.</p>
